To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?
Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.
As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.
Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.
We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other
A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.
What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.
The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.
Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.
There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.
Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?

We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.
Failure is not an option.
That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.
Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.
