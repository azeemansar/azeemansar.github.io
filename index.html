        <p>
            I'm a product-minded engineering leader & builder. Today I'm the CTO of <a href="attuneinsurance.com">Attune</a>, we make insurance easier for small businesses (Two Sigma was our lead investor, <a href="forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2021/10/05/coalition-acquires-attune-to-shape-the-future-of-insurance/">exited/acquired in 2021 by Coalition</a>).</p>
        <p>Before this, I worked on local products at Facebook, on growth engineering at Venmo, and on building several startups prior (including the incubator that birthed Tinder).
        </p>
        <p>
            I majored in math and minored in physics and computer science at the University of Pennsylvania.

    I care about...
    <ul class="dashed">
      <li><strong>Markets.</strong> Liquid markets with healthy price discovery yield truth and fairness. Atm I'm re-reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution-ebook/dp/B07P1NNTSD"> The Man Who Solved The Market</a>, about Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies.</li>
      <li><strong>Future.</strong> I read a lot of science fiction. I just picked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Consider-Phlebas-Culture-Novel-Book-ebook/dp/B0013TX6FI">Consider Phlebas</a> back up.</li>
      <li><strong>Tail Risk.</strong> What looming risks are severe but seem unlikely?</li>
      <li><strong>Engineering.</strong> Software or otherwise, but mostly software.</li>
      <li><strong>Wellness.</strong> I want to stay alive, ideally for as long and healthily as possible.</li>
